Brand/Product Page Finder — v1.6
- Brand-only pages now auto-extract product names from TEXT when JSON-LD/title don't have them.
- Heuristics: "Brand + Product Name" and "Product Name by Brand" with cleanup (e.g., remove "review").
- Limit how many product names per page are recorded (slider).
- Keeps grouping: Brand → Product → URLs + CSV exports.
