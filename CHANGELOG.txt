Brand/Product Page Finder â€” v1.9
- Results persist in session for 10 minutes by default (configurable). Cached results include a direct CSV (with URLs).
- Download button label clarified: 'full results (with URLs)' vs 'summary (no URLs)'.
- Stronger product-name cleanup: trims trailing lower-case/stopwords ('actually', 'has', 'lowest entrance', etc.).
- Canonicalization: if a detected phrase contains a known product name/alias for the brand, it snaps to the canonical name.
- One row per (brand, product, URL) guaranteed (de-duplication).
