Brand/Product Page Finder — v2.0
- NEW 'Summary (WITH URLs) CSV' — one row per product with pipe-separated URLs + page counts.
- Much stricter brand-only detection:
  • Avoids phrases starting with numbers; splits on commas to prevent list bleed.
  • Optional 'Product name must include brand word' (ON by default).
  • Safer tokenization & stopword trimming; ignores other brand names you list.
- Keeps results for 1–30 minutes (slider).
